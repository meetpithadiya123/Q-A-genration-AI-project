      "\n",
      "Okay class, let’s solidify our understanding of this foundational unit. Based on the text provided, here are five exam-style questions designed to test your knowledge.  I’ve aimed for questions that require you to apply the concepts, not just recall definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here are the questions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. (Conceptual Understanding - 10 Marks)**\n",
      "\n",
      "   The text outlines two primary categories of data representation: numeric and non-numeric. Explain, in your own words, why it’s important for a computer system to be able to represent both types of data. Provide a specific example of a situation where representing non-numeric data is crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. (Conversion & Application - 15 Marks)**\n",
      "\n",
      "   Consider the following calculation: `X = 5, Y = 10, Z = X + Y`.  The text mentions Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Octal representations of numeric data.  Explain *why* these different number systems are used in computer architecture.  Then, briefly describe how you would convert the decimal value of ‘Z’ (which is 15) into its hexadecimal representation.  Show your working.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. (Structure & Function - 10 Marks)**\n",
      "\n",
      "   The text introduces several data structures, including lists and trees.  Based on the information provided, what *general* role do data structures play in computer systems?  Explain your answer in the context of how a computer processes and stores information.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. (Architectural Distinction - 15 Marks)**\n",
      "\n",
      "   The text differentiates between \"Computer Architecture\" and \"Computer Organization.\"  Describe the key difference between these two concepts.  Use a simple analogy (e.g., a car) to illustrate your explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. (Micro-operations & Context - 20 Marks)**\n",
      "\n",
      "   The unit title mentions “Register Transfer and Micro-operations.”  Considering the broader context of the text – specifically the focus on computer data representation and architecture – what do you think “micro-operations” might refer to?  Explain your reasoning, linking it back to the concepts of binary representation and how data is manipulated within a computer. \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Notes for Students:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Show Your Work:**  For question 2, showing your conversion steps is crucial.\n",
      "*   **Explain Your Reasoning:**  Don’t just give answers; explain *why* you’re answering them.  This demonstrates a deeper understanding.\n",
      "*   **Connect the Concepts:**  The exam will likely test your ability to connect these different aspects of computer data representation – binary, data structures, architecture, and micro-operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any questions about these questions before we move on?  Let's discuss any areas you're finding challenging. \n",

Thus, numbers\\nin the binary system are represented to base 2.\\nOctal\\nIn the octal system (radix 8). The eight symbols are\\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\\nHexadecimal\\nHexadecimal (radix 16) , The 16 symbols of the hexadecimal system\\nare 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, 0, E, and F.\\nThe last six symbols are, unfortunately, identical to the letters of the\\nalphabet and can cause confusion at times.\\nHowever, this is the convention that has been adopted.\\nNumber Base Conversion\\nAs, we have four types of number systems so each one can be converted into the remaining\\nthree systems. There are the following conversions possible in Number System\\n1) Binary to other Number Systems.\\n2) Decimal to other Number Systems.\\n3) Octal to other Number Systems.\\n4) Hexadecimal to other Number Systems.\\nBinary to other Number Systems\\nThere are three conversions possible for binary number, i.e., binary to decimal, binary to octal,\\nand binary to hexadecimal.\\nThe conversion process of a binary number to decimal differs from the remaining others.\\nLet\\'s take a detailed discussion on Binary Number System conversion.\\nBinary to Decimal Conversion\\nThe process of converting binary to decimal is quite simple.\\nThe process starts from multiplying the bits of binary number with its corresponding positional weights.\\nAnd lastly, we add all those products.\\nExample 1: (10110.001)2\\nWe multiplied each bit of (10110.001)2 with its respective positional weight, and last we add the\\nproducts of all the bits with its weight.\\n(10110.001)2=(1×24)+(0×23)+(1×22)+(1×21)+(0×20) + (0×2-1)+(0×2-2)+(1×2-3)\\n(10110.001)2=(1×16)+(0×8)+(1×4)+(1×2)+(0×1) + (0×1⁄2)+(0×1⁄4)+(1×1⁄8)\\n(10110.001)2=16+0+4+2+0+0+0+0.125\\n(10110.001)2=(22.125 )10\\nBinary to Octal Conversion\\n• The base numbers of binary and octal are 2 and 8, respectively.\\n• In a binary number, the pair of three bits is equal to one octal digit.\\n• There are only two steps to convert a binary number into an octal number which are as\\nfollows:\\n1. In the first step, we have to make the pairs of three bits on both sides of the binary point.\\nIf there will be one or two bits left in a pair of three bits pair, we add the required number\\nof zeros on extreme sides.\\n2. In the second step, we write the octal digits corresponding to each pair.\\nBinary to Octal Conversion - Example\\n• Example 1: (111110101011.0011)2\\n• 1. Firstly, we make pairs of three bits on both sides of the binary point.\\n111 110 101 011.001 1\\n• On the right side of the binary point, the last pair has only one bit.\\n• To make it a complete pair of three bits, we added two zeros on the extreme side.\\n111 110 101 011.001 100\\n• 2. Then, we wrote the octal digits, which correspond to each pair.\\n(111110101011.0011)2=(7653.14)8\\nBinary to Hexadecimal Conversion\\n• The base numbers of binary and hexadecimal are 2 and 16, respectively.\\n• In a binary number, the pair of four bits is equal to one hexadecimal digit.\\n• There are also only two steps to convert a binary number into a hexadecimal number which\\nare as follows:\\n1. In the first step, we have to make the pairs of four bits on both sides of the binary point.\\nIf there will be one, two, or three bits left in a pair of four bits pair, we add the\\nrequired number of zeros on extreme sides.\\n2. In the second step, we write the hexadecimal digits corresponding to each pair.\\nBinary to Hexadecimal Conversion - Example\\n• Example 1: (10110101011.0011)2\\n• 1. Firstly, we make pairs of four bits on both sides of the binary point.\\n111 1010 1011.0011\\nOn the left side of the binary point, the first pair has three bits. To make it a complete pair of\\nfour bits, add one zero on the extreme side.\\n0111 1010 1011.0011\\n2. Then, we write the hexadecimal digits, which correspond to each pair.\\n(011110101011.0011)2=(7AB.3)16\\nDecimal to other Number \\nSystem\\nDecimal to other Number System\\n• The decimal number can be an integer or floating-point integer.\\n• When the decimal number is a floating-point integer, then we convert both part (integer and\\nfractional) of the decimal number in the isolated form(individually).\\n• There are the following steps that are used to convert the decimal number into a similar\\nnumber of any base \\'r\\'.\\n1. In the first step, we perform the division operation on integer and successive part with base\\n\\'r\\'. We will list down all the remainders till the quotient is zero. Then we find out the\\nremainders in reverse order for getting the integer part of the equivalent number of base \\'r\\'.\\nIn this, the least and most significant digits are denoted by the first and the last remainders.\\n2. In the next step, the multiplication operation is done with base \\'r\\' of the fractional and\\nsuccessive fraction. The carries are noted until the result is zero or when the required number\\nof the equivalent digit is obtained. For getting the fractional part of the equivalent number of\\nbase \\'r\\', the normal sequence of carrying is considered.\\nDecimal to Binary Conversion\\n• For converting decimal to binary, there are two steps required to perform, which are as\\nfollows:\\n1. In the first step, we perform the division operation on the integer and the successive quotient\\nwith the base of binary(2).\\n2. Next, we perform the multiplication on the integer and the successive quotient with the base\\nof binary(2).\\nDecimal to Binary Conversion - Example\\nExample 1: (152.25)10\\nStep 1:\\n• Divide the number 152 and its\\nsuccessive quotients with base 2.\\n• (152)10=(10011000)2\\nOperation Quotient Remainder\\n152/2 76 0 (LSB)\\n76/2 38 0\\n38/2 19 0\\n19/2 9 1\\n9/2 4 1\\n4/2 2 0\\n2/2 1 0\\n1/2 0 1(MSB)\\nExample 1: (152.25)10\\nStep 2:\\n• Now, perform the multiplication of 0.27\\nand successive fraction with base 2.\\n• (0.25)10=(.01)2\\nOperation Result carry\\n0.25×2 0.50 0\\n0.50×2 0 1\\nDecimal to Octal Conversion\\nFor converting decimal to octal, there are two steps required to perform, which are as follows:\\n1. In the first step, we perform the division operation on the integer and the successive quotient\\nwith the base of octal(8).\\n2. Next, we perform the multiplication on the integer and the successive quotient with the base of\\noctal(8).\\nOctal to other Number System\\nOctal to other Number System\\n• Like binary and decimal, the octal number can also be converted into other\\nnumber systems.\\n• The process of converting octal to decimal differs from the remaining one.\\n• Let\\'s start understanding how conversion is done.\\nOctal to Decimal Conversion\\n• The process of converting octal to decimal is the same as binary to decimal.\\n• The process starts from multiplying the digits of octal numbers with its corresponding positional\\nweights. And lastly, we add all those products.\\n• Let\\'s take an example to understand how the conversion is done from octal to decimal.\\nExample 1: (152.25)8\\nStep 1:We multiply each digit of 152.25 with its respective positional weight, and last we add the products\\nof all the bits with its weight.\\n(152.25)8=(1×82)+(5×81)+(2×80)+(2×8-1)+(5×8-2)\\n(152.25)8=64+40+2+(2×1⁄8)+(5×1⁄64)\\n(152.25)8=64+40+2+0.25+0.078125\\n(152.25)8=106.328125\\nSo, the decimal number of the octal number 152.25 is 106.328125\\nOctal to Binary Conversion\\n• The process of converting octal to binary is the reverse process of binary to octal.\\nWe write the three bits binary code of each octal number digit.\\n• Example 1: (152.25)8\\n• We write the three-bit binary digit for 1, 5, 2, and 5.\\n• (152.25)8=(001101010.010101)2\\n• So, the binary number of the octal number 152.25 is (001101010.010101)2\\nOctal to hexadecimal conversion\\n• For converting octal to hexadecimal, there are two steps required to perform,\\nwhich are as follows:\\n1. In the first step, we will find the binary equivalent of number.\\n2. Next, we have to make the pairs of four bits on both sides of the binary point.\\nIf there will be one, two, or three bits left in a pair of four bits pair, we add the\\nrequired number of zeros on extreme sides and write the hexadecimal digits\\ncorresponding to each pair.\\nOctal to hexadecimal conversion - Example\\nExample 1: (152.25)8\\nStep 1: We write the three-bit binary digit for 1, 5, 2, and 5.\\n(152.25)8=(001101010.010101)2\\n• So, the binary number of the octal number 152.25 is (001101010.010101)2\\nStep 2:\\n1. Now, we make pairs of four bits on both sides of the binary point.\\n0 0110 1010.0101 01\\nOctal to hexadecimal conversion - Example\\n• On the left side of the binary point, the first pair has only one digit, and on the\\nright side, the last pair has only two-digit.\\n• To make them complete pairs of four bits, add zeros on extreme sides.\\n0000 0110 1010.0101 0100\\n2. Now, we write the hexadecimal digits, which correspond to each pair.\\n(0000 0110 1010.0101 0100)2=(6A.54)16\\nHexa-decimal to other \\nNumber System\\nHexa-decimal to Decimal Conversion\\n• The process of converting hexadecimal to decimal is the same as binary to\\ndecimal.\\n• The process starts from multiplying the digits of hexadecimal numbers with its\\ncorresponding positional weights.

Thus, numbers\\nin the binary system are represented to base 2.Octal\\nIn the octal system (radix 8). The eight symbols are\\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.Hexadecimal\\nHexadecimal (radix 16) , The 16 symbols of the hexadecimal system\\nare 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, 0, E, and F.\\nThe last six symbols are, unfortunately, identical to the letters of the\\nalphabet and can cause confusion at times.\\nHowever, this is the convention that has been adopted.Number Base Conversion\\nAs, we have four types of number systems so each one can be converted into the remaining\\nthree systems. There are the following conversions possible in Number System\\n1) Binary to other Number Systems.\\n2) Decimal to other Number Systems.\\n3) Octal to other Number Systems.\\n4) Hexadecimal to other Number Systems.Binary to other Number Systems\\nThere are three conversions possible for binary number, i.e., binary to decimal, binary to octal,\\nand binary to hexadecimal.\\nThe conversion process of a binary number to decimal differs from the remaining others.\\nLet\\'s take a detailed discussion on Binary Number System conversion.Binary to Decimal Conversion\\nThe process of converting binary to decimal is quite simple.\\nThe process starts from multiplying the bits of binary number with its corresponding positional weights.\\nAnd lastly, we add all those products.\\nExample 1: (10110.001)2\\nWe multiplied each bit of (10110.001)2 with its respective positional weight, and last we add the\\nproducts of all the bits with its weight.\\n(10110.001)2=(1×24)+(0×23)+(1×22)+(1×21)+(0×20) + (0×2-1)+(0×2-2)+(1×2-3)\\n(10110.001)2=(1×16)+(0×8)+(1×4)+(1×2)+(0×1) + (0×1⁄2)+(0×1⁄4)+(1×1⁄8)\\n(10110.001)2=16+0+4+2+0+0+0+0.125\\n(10110.001)2=(22.125 )10Binary to Octal Conversion\\n• The base numbers of binary and octal are 2 and 8, respectively.\\n• In a binary number, the pair of three bits is equal to one octal digit.\\n• There are only two steps to convert a binary number into an octal number which are as\\nfollows:\\n1. In the first step, we have to make the pairs of three bits on both sides of the binary point.\\nIf there will be one or two bits left in a pair of three bits pair, we add the required number\\nof zeros on extreme sides.\\n2. In the second step, we write the octal digits corresponding to each pair.Binary to Octal Conversion - Example\\n• Example 1: (111110101011.0011)2\\n• 1. Firstly, we make pairs of three bits on both sides of the binary point.\\n111 110 101 011.001 1\\n• On the right side of the binary point, the last pair has only one bit.\\n• To make it a complete pair of three bits, we added two zeros on the extreme side.\\n111 110 101 011.001 100\\n• 2. Then, we wrote the octal digits, which correspond to each pair.\\n(111110101011.0011)2=(7653.14)8Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion\\n• The base numbers of binary and hexadecimal are 2 and 16, respectively.\\n• In a binary number, the pair of four bits is equal to one hexadecimal digit.\\n• There are also only two steps to convert a binary number into a hexadecimal number which\\nare as follows:\\n1. In the first step, we have to make the pairs of four bits on both sides of the binary point.\\nIf there will be one, two, or three bits left in a pair of four bits pair, we add the\\nrequired number of zeros on extreme sides.\\n2.

Then, we write the hexadecimal digits, which correspond to each pair.\\n(011110101011.0011)2=(7AB.3)16Decimal to other Number \\nSystemDecimal to other Number System\\n• The decimal number can be an integer or floating-point integer.\\n• When the decimal number is a floating-point integer, then we convert both part (integer and\\nfractional) of the decimal number in the isolated form(individually).\\n• There are the following steps that are used to convert the decimal number into a similar\\nnumber of any base \\'r\\'.\\n1. In the first step, we perform the division operation on integer and successive part with base\\n\\'r\\'. We will list down all the remainders till the quotient is zero. Then we find out the\\nremainders in reverse order for getting the integer part of the equivalent number of base \\'r\\'.\\nIn this, the least and most significant digits are denoted by the first and the last remainders.\\n2. In the next step, the multiplication operation is done with base \\'r\\' of the fractional and\\nsuccessive fraction. The carries are noted until the result is zero or when the required number\\nof the equivalent digit is obtained. For getting the fractional part of the equivalent number of\\nbase \\'r\\', the normal sequence of carrying is considered.Decimal to Binary Conversion\\n• For converting decimal to binary, there are two steps required to perform, which are as\\nfollows:\\n1. In the first step, we perform the division operation on the integer and the successive quotient\\nwith the base of binary(2).\\n2. Next, we perform the multiplication on the integer and the successive quotient with the base\\nof binary(2).Decimal to Binary Conversion - Example\\nExample 1: (152.25)10\\nStep 1:\\n• Divide the number 152 and its\\nsuccessive quotients with base 2.\\n• (152)10=(10011000)2\\nOperation Quotient Remainder\\n152/2 76 0 (LSB)\\n76/2 38 0\\n38/2 19 0\\n19/2 9 1\\n9/2 4 1\\n4/2 2 0\\n2/2 1 0\\n1/2 0 1(MSB)\\nExample 1: (152.25)10\\nStep 2:\\n• Now, perform the multiplication of 0.27\\nand successive fraction with base 2.\\n• (0.25)10=(.01)2\\nOperation Result carry\\n0.25×2 0.50 0\\n0.50×2 0 1Decimal to Octal Conversion\\nFor converting decimal to octal, there are two steps required to perform, which are as follows:\\n1. In the first step, we perform the division operation on the integer and the successive quotient\\nwith the base of octal(8).\\n2. Next, we perform the multiplication on the integer and the successive quotient with the base of\\noctal(8).Octal to other Number SystemOctal to other Number System\\n• Like binary and decimal, the octal number can also be converted into other\\nnumber systems.\\n• The process of converting octal to decimal differs from the remaining one.\\n• Let\\'s start understanding how conversion is done.Octal to Decimal Conversion\\n• The process of converting octal to decimal is the same as binary to decimal.\\n• The process starts from multiplying the digits of octal numbers with its corresponding positional\\nweights. And lastly, we add all those products.\\n• Let\\'s take an example to understand how the conversion is done from octal to decimal.\\nExample 1: (152.25)8\\nStep 1:We multiply each digit of 152.25 with its respective positional weight, and last we add the products\\nof all the bits with its weight.\\n(152.25)8=(1×82)+(5×81)+(2×80)+(2×8-1)+(5×8-2)\\n(152.25)8=64+40+2+(2×1⁄8)+(5×1⁄64)\\n(152.25)8=64+40+2+0.25+0.078125\\n(152.25)8=106.328125\\nSo, the decimal number of the octal number 152.25 is 106.328125Octal to Binary Conversion\\n• The process of converting octal to binary is the reverse process of binary to octal.\\nWe write the three bits binary code of each octal number digit.\\n• Example 1: (152.25)8\\n• We write the three-bit binary digit for 1, 5, 2, and 5.\\n• (152.25)8=(001101010.010101)2\\n• So, the binary number of the octal number 152.25 is (001101010.010101)2Octal to hexadecimal conversion\\n• For converting octal to hexadecimal, there are two steps required to perform,\\nwhich are as follows:\\n1. In the first step, we will find the binary equivalent of number.\\n2. Next, we have to make the pairs of four bits on both sides of the binary point.\\nIf there will be one, two, or three bits left in a pair of four bits pair, we add the\\nrequired number of zeros on extreme sides and write the hexadecimal digits\\ncorresponding to each pair.Octal to hexadecimal conversion - Example\\nExample 1: (152.25)8\\nStep 1: We write the three-bit binary digit for 1, 5, 2, and 5.\\n(152.25)8=(001101010.010101)2\\n• So, the binary number of the octal number 152.25 is (001101010.010101)2\\nStep 2:\\n1. Now, we make pairs of four bits on both sides of the binary point.\\n0 0110 1010.0101 01Octal to hexadecimal conversion - Example\\n• On the left side of the binary point, the first pair has only one digit, and on the\\nright side, the last pair has only two-digit.\\n• To make them complete pairs of four bits, add zeros on extreme sides.\\n0000 0110 1010.0101 0100\\n2. Now, we write the hexadecimal digits, which correspond to each pair.\\n(0000 0110 1010.0101 0100)2=(6A.54)16Hexa-decimal to other \\nNumber SystemHexa-decimal to Decimal Conversion\\n• The process of converting hexadecimal to decimal is the same as binary to\\ndecimal.\\n• The process starts from multiplying the digits of hexadecimal numbers with its\\ncorresponding positional weights. And lastly, we add all those products.Hexa-decimal to Decimal Conversion - Example\\n• Example 1: (152A.25)16\\n• Step 1:We multiply each digit of 152A.25 with its respective positional weight, and last\\nwe add the products of all the bits with its weight.\\n• (152A.25)16=(1×163)+(5×162)+(2×161)+(A×160)+(2×16-1)+(5×16-2)\\n• (152A.25)16=(1×4096)+(5×256)+(2×16)+(10×1)+(2×16-1)+(5×16-2)\\n• (152A.25)16=4096+1280+32+10+(2×1⁄16)+(5×1⁄256)\\n• (152A.25)16=5418+0.125+0.125\\n• (152A.25)16=5418.14453125\\n• So, the decimal number of the hexadecimal number 152A.25 is 5418.14453125Hexadecimal to Binary Conversion\\n• The process of converting hexadecimal to binary is the reverse process of binary\\nto hexadecimal.\\n• We write the four bits binary code of each hexadecimal number digit.\\nExample 1: (152A.25)16\\n• We write the four-bit binary digit for 1, 5, A, 2, and 5.\\n• (152A.25)16=(0001 0101 0010 1010.0010 0101)2Hexadecimal to Octal Conversion\\n• For converting hexadecimal to octal, there are two steps required to perform,\\nwhich are as follows:\\n1. In the first step, we will find the binary equivalent of the hexadecimal number.\\n2. Next, we have to make the pairs of three bits on both sides of the binary point.\\nIf there will be one or two bits left in a pair of three bits pair, we add the required\\nnumber of zeros on extreme sides and write the octal digits corresponding to each\\npair.Hexadecimal to Octal Conversion - Example\\nExample 1: (152A.25)16\\nStep 1: We write the four-bit binary digit for 1, 5, 2, A, and 5.\\n• (152A.25)16=(0001 0101 0010 1010.0010 0101)2\\n• So, the binary number of hexadecimal number 152A.25 is (0011010101010.010101)2\\nStep 2: Then, we make pairs of three bits on both sides of the binary point.\\n• 001 010 100 101 010.001 001 010\\nThen, we write the octal digit, which corresponds to each pair.\\n• (001010100101010.001001010)2=(12452.112)81’s Complements\\n• Note:- 1’s and 2’s complement can easily determined on Binary Number Only.\\n(1) (45) = (101101)\\n1’s Complement:-\\nTo find 1’s Complement, Just reverse the bits of Binary Value (0 -> 1, 1-> 0).\\nBinary 1 0 1 1 0 1\\n1’s Complement 0 1 0 0 1 0\\n10 22’s Complements\\n• To Find 2’s complement, Just add 1 in the 1’s Complement.\\n(1) (45) = (101101)\\n1’s Complement:-\\nTo find 1’s Complement, Just reverse the bits of Binary Value (0 -> 1, 1-> 0).\\nBinary 1 0 1 1 0 1\\n1’s Complement 0 1 0 0 1 0\\n1\\n-----------------\\n2’s Complement 0 1 0 0 1 1\\n10 22’s complement2’s Complements\\n• Directly Find 2’s Complement form Binary Number\\n• From the Right to Left of Binary Number, find the 1st 1, and write the same Binary\\nValue.\\n• After the First 1, Reverse the remaining Bits of Binary Value.\\n• Examples:\\n• (1) (101010)\\n• (2) (10100)\\n• (3) (100101)Complement No. System\\n• To Find (n-1)’s Complement of any given base, Find the highest Number of that\\nbase .\\n• For Ex.
